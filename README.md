# MonitorPath

Pass the argument -path for the path you want to monitor and that's all.

*You can change the path for the log "MonitorPath.txt" for any path you want, in my case it was D:\Log\MonitorPath.txt. Just change it in the ps1 file if you want to.*

---

**In the command line:**

```console
powershell .\MonitorPath.ps1 -path "C:\AnyFolder"
```
